# rpm

A simple and fast Rust-based Package Manager for the npm registry. It allows you to install dependencies from `package.json`, add new packages, and manage a local cache, serving as a lightweight alternative to npm or yarn.

## Installation

You can install `rpm` by cloning the repository and building it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lassejlv/rpm
cd rpm
cargo install --path .
```
